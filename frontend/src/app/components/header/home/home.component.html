        <h3><strong>Message from the Head</strong></h3>
        <p style="font-size: 16px;">Raw materials demand for the welfare and subsistence needs of mankind is ever increasing with the advancement of science and technology. However, the mineral market often faces challenges due to uniqueness of mineral resources. This puts the mining and mineral resource engineers under challenge to find new ways of production, beneficiation and marketing of coal, different ores and petroleum. To this end as an important stakeholder of the mineral industry, the mining academics at IIT Kharagpur have been trying their best to produce quality manpower to serve the mining and allied industries. The skills learned herein enable the graduates to develop opportunities to play their in wide ranging fields, including in the finance and digital sectors. No doubt these who join mining industry excel when they continue. It is expected in the days to come, the Indian mining industry will retain some of our best graduates to serve the country√¢ s mineral exploitation needs.</p>
