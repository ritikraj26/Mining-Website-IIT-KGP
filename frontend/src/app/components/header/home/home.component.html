      <h3><strong>Message from the Head</strong></h3>
      <p>Raw materials demand for the welfare and subsistence needs of mankind is ever increasing with the advancement of science and technology. However, the mineral market often faces challenges due to the uniqueness of mineral resources. This puts mining and mineral resource engineers under pressure to find new ways of production, beneficiation, and marketing of coal, different ores, and petroleum. As an important stakeholder in the mineral industry, the mining academics at IIT Kharagpur have been trying their best to produce quality manpower to serve the mining and allied industries. The skills learned here enable graduates to excel in diverse fields, including finance and digital sectors. We expect that, in the future, the Indian mining industry will retain some of our best graduates to serve the country's mineral exploitation needs.</p>
